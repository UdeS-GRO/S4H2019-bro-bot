The library p_monitor.h is a derived version of the p_monitor OpenCr example in the arduino IDE. You should read the p_monitor.cpp before 
using it to be aware of its license. 

This library is used to symplify the way of sending commands to the Dynamixel motors. If you want to use our main_opencr program, you
should copy this directory inside your /Arduino/libraries. In Windows it should be in C:\Users\user\Documents\Arduino\libraries.
