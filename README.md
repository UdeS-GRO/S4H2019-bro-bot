Welcome to our college robotic project. We are the Bro-bot team and for a our session project we had to make an open source robotic project.

The Bro-Bot is a 3 degrees of freedom robot arm with a gripper at its end. The robot has 3 different control sytems: joint-directly controlled, cartesian teach controlled and impedance controlled. The grimper, on the other hand, is controlled by a wireless glove with flex sensors (inspired by a youtube project https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEd2B7fS8Eg&t=777s).

The team: 
We are at Université de Sherbrooke in the robotic engineering program. The team is composed of Tristan Dumais, Philippe Doucerain, Jean-Michel Lemaire, Maxime Lamoureux, Marc-André Martel and Étienne Villemure


## Start the project 
All materials to acquired and all the necessary softfwares to download can be found in this Github wiki in the section **Getting started!!**
